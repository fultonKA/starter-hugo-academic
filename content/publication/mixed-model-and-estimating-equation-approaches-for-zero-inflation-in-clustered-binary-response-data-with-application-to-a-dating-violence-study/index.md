abstract: The NEXT Generation Health study investigates the dating violence of
  adolescents using a survey questionnaire. Each student is asked to affirm or
  deny multiple instances of violence in his/her dating relationship. There is,
  however, evidence suggesting that students not in a relationship responded to
  the survey, resulting in excessive zeros in the responses. This paper proposes
  likelihood-based and estimating equation approaches to analyze the
  zero-inflated clustered binary response data. We adopt a mixed model method to
  account for the cluster effect, and the model parameters are estimated using a
  maximum-likelihood (ML) approach that requires a Gaussianâ€“Hermite quadrature
  (GHQ) approximation for implementation. Since an incorrect assumption on the
  random effects distribution may bias the results, we construct generalized
  estimating equations (GEE) that do not require the correct specification of
  within-cluster correlation. In a series of simulation studies, we examine the
  performance of ML and GEE methods in terms of their bias, efficiency and
  robustness. We illustrate the importance of properly accounting for this zero
  inflation by reanalyzing the NEXT data where this issue has previously been
  ignored.
