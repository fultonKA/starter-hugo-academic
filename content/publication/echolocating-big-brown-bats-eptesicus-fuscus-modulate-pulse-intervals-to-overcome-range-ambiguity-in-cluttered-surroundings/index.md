abstract: Big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) emit trains of brief, wideband
  frequency-modulated (FM) echolocation sounds and use echoes of these sounds to
  orient, find insects, and guide flight through vegetation. They are observed
  to emit sounds that alternate between short and long inter-pulse intervals
  (IPIs), forming sonar sound groups. The occurrence of these strobe groups has
  been linked to flight in cluttered acoustic environments, but how exactly bats
  use sonar sound groups to orient and navigate is still a mystery. Here, the
  production of sound groups during clutter navigation was examined. Controlled
  flight experiments were conducted where the proximity of the nearest obstacles
  was systematically decreased while the extended scene was kept constant. Four
  bats flew along a corridor of varying widths (100, 70, and 40 cm) bounded by
  rows of vertically hanging plastic chains while in-flight echolocation calls
  were recorded. Bats shortened their IPIs for more rapid spatial sampling and
  also grouped their sounds more tightly when flying in narrower corridors. Bats
  emitted echolocation calls with progressively shorter IPIs over the course of
  a flight, and began their flights by emitting shorter starting IPI calls when
  clutter was denser. The percentage of sound groups containing 3 or more calls
  increased with increasing clutter proximity. Moreover, IPI sequences having
  internal structure become more pronounced when corridor width narrows. A novel
  metric for analyzing the temporal organization of sound sequences was
  developed, and the results indicate that the time interval between
  echolocation calls depends heavily on the preceding time interval. The
  occurrence of specific IPI patterns were dependent upon clutter, which
  suggests that sonar sound grouping may be an adaptive strategy for coping with
  pulse-echo ambiguity in cluttered surroundings.
